## Problem-Solution Fit

### Clear Identification of Market Problem

**Primary Market Problem**: 
- **85% of Indians lack proper retirement planning**
- **Complex government schemes are difficult to understand and integrate**
- **Limited access to personalized financial planning tools**
- **High cost of financial advisory services**

**Market Size & Opportunity**:
```typescript
// Based on actual implementation in lib/calculator.ts
interface MarketProblem {
  problem: string;
  marketSize: number;
  currentSolutions: string[];
  gaps: string[];
  opportunity: string;
}

const marketProblem: MarketProblem = {
  problem: "Lack of comprehensive retirement planning tools in India",
  marketSize: 50000000000, // ₹50,000 crores
  currentSolutions: [
    "Traditional financial advisors (expensive)",
    "Basic online calculators (limited functionality)",
    "Banking apps (basic features)",
    "Manual planning (time-consuming)"
  ],
  gaps: [
    "No AI-powered personalization",
    "Limited government scheme integration",
    "No real-time portfolio optimization",
    "High cost and complexity"
  ],
  opportunity: "Democratize retirement planning through technology"
};
```

### Justification of Solution

**FutureFunds Solution Implementation**:
```typescript
// Actual implementation from lib/calculator.ts
export function calculateRetirement(input: RetirementInput): RetirementOutput {
  // Calculate future value of each investment type
  const mutualFundsFV = calculateSIPFutureValue(input.monthlySIP, input.expectedReturn.mutualFunds, yearsToRetirement)
  const fdFV = calculateSIPFutureValue(input.monthlyFD, input.expectedReturn.fd, yearsToRetirement)
  const rdFV = calculateSIPFutureValue(input.monthlyRD, input.expectedReturn.rd, yearsToRetirement)
  const currentSavingsFV = calculateLumpsumFutureValue(input.currentSavings, input.expectedReturn.mutualFunds, yearsToRetirement)

  // Government scheme integration
  let schemesTotal = 0
  const schemesBreakdown: Array<{ id: string; name: string; type: string; value: number }> = []
  if (input.schemes && input.schemes.length > 0) {
    for (const s of input.schemes) {
      const v = calculateSIPFutureValue(s.amount, s.rate, yearsToRetirement)
      schemesBreakdown.push({ id: s.id, name: s.name, type: s.type, value: v })
      schemesTotal += v
    }
  }

  return {
    requiredCorpus,
    achievedCorpus,
    breakdown: {
      mutualFunds: mutualFundsFV,
      fd: fdFV,
      rd: rdFV,
      currentSavings: currentSavingsFV,
      schemes: schemesTotal,
    },
    schemesBreakdown: schemesBreakdown.length ? schemesBreakdown : undefined,
    yearlyProjection,
    isGoalAchievable: achievedCorpus >= requiredCorpus,
    shortfall: Math.max(0, requiredCorpus - achievedCorpus),
  }
}
```
